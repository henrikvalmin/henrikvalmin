### Hi there, I'm Henrik Abrahamsson üëã

üßî &nbsp; 3rd year engineering student 

üìç &nbsp; LTH (Lund, Sweden). 

#### Currently working on

üñ•Ô∏è &nbsp; Learning React.js 


#### Passions
I'm passionate about most things coding related, in the sense that I usually get excited not only about solving coding problems but more notably, about using code to solve problems that weren't coding related to begin with. 

I'm currently very excited to be learning more about the front-end of applications and designing them in a user friendly fashion (applying the knowledge I've gained from numerous Cognition and Interaction Design courses). However, I was equally excited while learning about setting up databases and APIs in order to interact with them, so it seems my enthusiasm goes both ways. 

I started out with Java, where I'm most proficient since it's the language of choice at my university, but in my spare time I try to expand my knowledge by learning new tools and techniques.
